# ASPNET MVC FILTER
ASP.NET MVC Filter is a custom class where you can write custom logic to execute before or after an action method executes. Filters can be applied to an action method or controller in a declarative or programmatic way. Declarative means by applying a filter attribute to an action method or controller class and programmatic means by implementing a corresponding interface. 

MVC provides different types of filters. Below are some in-built filters in ASPNET MVC
  -Authorization [Authorize]
  -Action
  -Result [OutputCache]
  -Exception [HandleError]
